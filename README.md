This repository implements a C++ program for constructing suffix arrays using the efficient induced sorting algorithm, which organizes suffixes of a string in lexicographical order. The algorithm classifies suffixes into S-type and L-type, identifies LMS substrings, sorts them, and then induces the order for remaining suffixes, achieving O(n) time complexity. It supports ASCII and extended characters and is suitable for applications like pattern matching and data compression. To use, compile sais.cpp with a C++17 or later compiler, provide an input string, and the program outputs the suffix array.
